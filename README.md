# IPU-Notes-hub

Let's share notes.

Noteshub is always down, we need a better collaborated environment for sharing notes. Hence this repo.


PRs are welcome.

# How to contribute?

If you are/were an GGSIPU(IPU) student of btech course and you have good material (notes, previous year papers, ppts) then you are good to go. Just create a PR describing what you are sharing and make a separate folder for it. 

For example if you want to share notes for subject `A` of `Semester 3` then create a folder `Semester 3/A/Notes/your_material.format`.
Similary for subject `A`'s previous year paper or akash make a PR to `Semester 3/A/Papers/your_material.format`.

If material is bigger than 25 MB limit, raise a pr and add a link to the material and I shall download it and add it in the mega folder.
